<p>
  Argentine Tango is passionate, sensual, elegant, romantic, intuitive, improvised and heartfelt. It is created "in the moment" from a variety of basic steps and hence is a pure form of communication - without words - a moving meditation to music.
</p>

<p>
  Experience the magic, relax, have fun, get fit, meet new people, and be emotionally uplifted!
